# Appointment clash detection.


## First,

Download the [Project template](./appointment.zip) and unzip.


## Problem,

Consider the class Appointment given in 'appointment.js'. This data structure
represents an appointment in calender. It has a start time and an end time.

Your job is to write the logic for the ```clashesWith``` method.

This method takes in one argument, another appointment. It should detect if there are
any time clashes between "this" appointment and the other appointment.


## Instructions,

1. Code the ```clashes``` method.
1. Test your code with ```main.js```. **Remember**, the given ```main.js``` has only
one scenario, of appointment clash there are many, many more
1. Post your code on a github gist
1. Announce your submission with gist url on slack


## NOTES,

1. Your script should be runnable on node.
1. The ```main.js``` just to test your code, you do not need to submit it.
5. **DO NOT** change the names of ```Appointment``` class and ```clashesWith``` method. Evaluation is
   by running against test cases. So if the names are diffrent you will get a zero.
1. You might have to make some assumptions. Clearly write them down in the comments.
2. Scoring:
   - 1st person to submit           10 points
   - how elegant is your solution?  50 points
   - how short is your code?        30 points
   - code formatting and alignment  10 points

3. We will reject your code if is badly formatted!
4. BEFORE starting to code, consider ALL the cases where an appointment can overlap.
